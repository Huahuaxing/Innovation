Verify these issues exist and fix them:

Bug 1:
The nested loops iterate through all 20 cracks and 5 sub-models for each stress and group, but the result `V_dry(stressNum, :, :, groupNum)` is overwritten in every iteration of the inner loops instead of being computed once per stress state. Only the velocity from the last crack (crackNum=20) and last sub-model (subNum=5) is stored. This produces incorrect wave velocity calculations that don't account for the actual combination of all cracks. Compare with `Func_C_eff.m` which properly accumulates contributions from all cracks using `Z_intermediate`.

Bug 2:
The hardcoded path references `03_Calculate_Ceff_and_Wave_Velocity` but the actual directory is named `03_Ceff_and_Wave_Velocity` (without the word "Calculate"). The `mkdir` command on line 9-10 will fail when trying to create the directory with this incorrect path, preventing the script from saving results.

Bug 3:
The code attempts to access `prop.mu` but the JSON structure created in `parameters_enjson.m` defines the field as `params.MU` (uppercase). In MATLAB, JSON field names are case-sensitive. This will cause a runtime error: "Reference to non-existent field 'mu'" when the script tries to load and access the property.
